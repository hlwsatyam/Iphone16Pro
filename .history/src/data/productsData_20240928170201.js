            The iPhone 16 Pro features a 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion technology, delivering smoother 
            scrolling, responsive touch, and vibrant colors for an immersive visual experience. Whether you're gaming, 
            watching videos, or editing photos, this display makes everything look and feel more fluid. The Desert Titanium 
            finish adds a refined and luxurious touch to the design, making the iPhone 16 Pro stand out in any setting.
            
            Powered by the latest A18 Bionic chip, the iPhone 16 Pro offers unmatched speed and efficiency. Whether you're

            48MP main sensor, an ultra-wide camera, and a telephoto lens, offering stunning clarity, depth, and detail in 
            every shot. Night mode has been enhanced for even better low-light photography, and the improved portrait mode
